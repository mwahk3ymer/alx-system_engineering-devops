 Resolution:

Browser initiates a DNS request to translate "www.google.com" into an IP address.
Request to Server IP on Appropriate Port:

Browser establishes a TCP connection with the server's IP address on the appropriate port (usually port 443 for HTTPS).
Encrypted Traffic (HTTPS):

SSL/TLS encryption ensures secure communication between the browser and the server.
Firewall:

Data packets pass through a firewall, which monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.
Load Balancer:

If applicable (for high-traffic sites), a load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers for optimal resource utilization.
Web Server:

The web server processes HTTP/HTTPS requests, retrieves requested resources, and sends them back to the browser.
Application Server:

In cases of dynamic content, the application server generates the web page. It may also handle server-side scripts.
Database:

The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update data as needed.
